Welcome to my first blog post on GitHub Pages!

This is an exciting milestone in learning how to use GitHub Pages with Jekyll. I'm exploring how to create a blog using specially named files and frontmatter.

Some things I've learned so far:
- GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to build static sites
- Blog posts need to follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` naming convention
- Frontmatter uses YAML syntax and goes at the top of the file
- The `title` and `date` fields are required in the frontmatter

I'm looking forward to sharing more content and learning more about web development with GitHub Pages!
